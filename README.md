yarn dev
```

#### or

7. If you want the search functionality to work, follow these steps

   1. Make an account at [algolia](https://www.algolia.com/)
   2. add environment variables to env file (found it the dashboard under the api keys tab)

   ```
    ALGOLIA_APP_ID=***
    ALGOLIA_API_KEY=***
    ALGOLIA_ADMIN_KEY=***
   ```

   3. run `yarn create-indices` (this command will have to be run every time you wish to update the indices)
   4. Complete the setup for each index (located on the right side panel)
      1. Configure searchable attributes (must add excerpt)
      2. Configure custom ranking (must add excerpt)

## Gathering Feedback with Github

People can submit  feedback from any documentation page. This feedback is immediately posted to GitHub and stored as issues to the repository of your choosing.
GitHub issues are an awesome way to store feeback, make it searchable, filterable on page URL or reaction types for instance, and you can choose to be notified of any new comment on your website ðŸ””.

### Setup

1. [Make a personal GitHub access token](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token) ðŸ‘ˆ This is the GitHub user that posts any new feedback. Feel free to create a dedicated GitHub account for this.
2. Add the following environement variables:
```env
USERNAME_ISSUES=<GitHub username>
GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN=<personal access token>
REPO_ISSUES=<repository-name> 
```

Make sure issues are activated in the repository settings.

3. Run NextJS in development mode to test:
```bash
yarn
yarn dev
```
4. Submit a feedback from the form at the bottom of a documenation page on your site. 
5.  ðŸ‘€ Check your GitHub repository if an issue has been created.

## Gathering Feedback with another endpoint

If you want to use another service ([like Formspree](https://formspree.io/)) you can change the endpoint that the form is send to. Simple add the following line to your `.env` file 
```
FEEDBACK_ENDPOINT=https://example.com
```
