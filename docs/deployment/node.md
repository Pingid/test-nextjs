**Node.js** is an [open-source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software "Open-source software"), [cross-platform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-platform "Cross-platform"), [back-end](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front_end_and_back_end "Front end and back end") [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript "JavaScript") [runtime environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runtime_environment "Runtime environment") that executes JavaScript code outside a [web browser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser "Web browser"). Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and for [server-side scripting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server-side_scripting "Server-side scripting")—running scripts server-side to produce [dynamic web page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_web_page "Dynamic web page") content before the page is sent to the user's web browser. Consequently, Node.js represents a "JavaScript everywhere" paradigm,[\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node.js#cite_note-6) unifying [web-application](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application "Web application") development around a single programming language, rather than different languages for server-side and client-side scripts.

Though `.js` is the standard [filename extension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filename_extension "Filename extension") for JavaScript code, the name "Node.js" doesn't refer to a particular file in this context and is merely the name of the product. Node.js has an [event-driven architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event-driven_architecture "Event-driven architecture")capable of [asynchronous I/O](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asynchronous_I/O "Asynchronous I/O"). These design choices aim to optimize [throughput](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Throughput "Throughput") and [scalability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalability "Scalability") in web applications with many input/output operations, as well as for [real-time Web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_Web "Real-time Web") applications (e.g., [real-time communication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_communication "Real-time communication") programs and [browser games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_game "Browser game")).

The Node.js [distributed development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_development "Distributed development") project was previously governed by the Node.js Foundation, and has now merged with the [JS Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JS_Foundation "JS Foundation") to form the [OpenJS Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenJS_Foundation "OpenJS Foundation"), which is facilitated by the [Linux Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_Foundation "Linux Foundation")'s Collaborative Projects program.
