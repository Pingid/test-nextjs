macOS is the second major series of [Macintosh operating systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_operating_systems "Macintosh operating systems"). The first is colloquially called the [classic Mac OS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classic_Mac_OS "Classic Mac OS"), introduced in 1984, the final release of which was [Mac OS 9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_9 "Mac OS 9") in 1999. The first desktop version, [Mac OS X 10.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_X_10.0 "Mac OS X 10.0"), was released in March 2001, with its first update, 10.1, arriving later that year. After this, Apple began naming its releases after [big cats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_cat "Big cat"), which lasted until [OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS_X_Mountain_Lion "OS X Mountain Lion"). Since [OS X 10.9 Mavericks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS_X_Mavericks "OS X Mavericks"), releases have been named after locations in [California](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California "California").Apple shortened the name to "OS X" in 2012 and then changed it to "macOS" in 2016, adopting the [nomenclature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nomenclature "Nomenclature") that they were using for their other operating systems, [iOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS "IOS"), [watchOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WatchOS "WatchOS"), and [tvOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TvOS "TvOS"). The latest version is [macOS Catalina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS_Catalina "MacOS Catalina"), which was publicly released in October 2019. — source: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS")
