**Ubuntu** ([/ʊˈbʊntuː/](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English "Help:IPA/English") is a [Linux distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_distribution "Linux distribution") based on [Debian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debian "Debian") and mostly composed of [free and open-source software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software "Free and open-source software").

Ubuntu is officially released in three editions: _[Desktop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_computer "Desktop computer")_, _[Server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_(computing) "Server (computing)")_, and _Core_ for [Internet of things](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things "Internet of things") devices and [robots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robot "Robot"). All the editions can run on the computer alone, or in a [virtual machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine "Virtual machine"). Ubuntu is a popular [operating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system "Operating system") for [cloud computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing "Cloud computing"), with support for [OpenStack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenStack "OpenStack"). Ubuntu's default desktop has been [GNOME](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNOME "GNOME"), since version 17.10.

Ubuntu is released every six months, with [long-term support](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-term_support "Long-term support") (LTS) releases every two years. As of 22 October 2020, the most recent long-term support release is [20.04](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu_version_history#2004 "Ubuntu version history") ("Focal Fossa"), which is supported until 2025 under public support and until 2030 as a paid option. The latest standard release is 20.10 ("Groovy Gorilla"), which is supported for nine months.

Ubuntu is [developed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development "Software development") by [Canonical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canonical_(company) "Canonical (company)"), and a community of other developers, under a meritocratic governance model. Canonical provides security updates and support for each Ubuntu release, starting from the release date and until the release reaches its designated [end-of-life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-of-life_(product) "End-of-life (product)") (EOL) date. Canonical generates revenue through the sale of premium services related to Ubuntu.

Ubuntu is named after the [Nguni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nguni_people "Nguni people") philosophy of _[ubuntu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu_philosophy "Ubuntu philosophy")_, which Canonical indicates means "humanity to others" with a connotation of "I am what I am because of who we all are".
