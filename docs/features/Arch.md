**Arch Linux** ([/ɑːrtʃ/](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English "Help:IPA/English")) is a [Linux distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_distribution "Linux distribution") for computers with [x86-64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86-64 "X86-64") processors. Arch Linux adheres to the [KISS principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle "KISS principle") ("Keep It Simple, Stupid") and is focused on simplicity, modernity, pragmatism, user centrality, and versatility. In practice, this means the project attempts to have minimal distribution-specific changes, minimal breakage with updates, pragmatic over ideological design choices and focuses on user-centrality\[_[clarification needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Please_clarify "Wikipedia:Please clarify")_\] rather than user-friendliness.

A [package manager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Package_manager "Package manager") written specifically for Arch Linux, [Pacman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arch_Linux#Pacman), is used to install, remove and update [software packages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Package_(package_management_system) "Package (package management system)"). Arch Linux uses a [rolling release model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_release "Rolling release"), meaning there are no "major releases" of completely new versions of the system; a regular system update is all that is needed to obtain the latest Arch software; the installation images released every month by the Arch team are simply up-to-date snapshots of the main system components.
